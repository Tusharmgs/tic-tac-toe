## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Enter both player names on the home screen.  
2. Click **Start Game**.  
3. Take turns placing X and O on the grid.  
4. First to align 3 marks (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins!  
5. Use **Reset** to play again or **Restart** to start over completely.

## 🧠 Game Logic Highlights

- The game board is stored as a **9-element array**.  
- Winning combinations are checked after each move.  
- Player switching handled by a **toggle-based state system**.  
- The scoreboard dynamically updates after each win.

Example snippet:
```js
const lines = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8],
  [0, 3, 6],
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [0, 4, 8],
  [2, 4, 6],
];
```
